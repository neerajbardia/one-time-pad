# one-time-pad
This is another cryptography technique, in it the key is as long as the plaintext itself. this is a very strong cipher.
The key is first taken from the user as an input and then a key is generated so that it is as long as the plaintext.

# encryption
The encryption process is quite simple, the index of all the letters of the key are mapped to the plaintext, as they both are of the same length there will be a letter of plaintext for every letter of the key. Then the characters are added and the result is rounded off to get the new letter.
This is how the encryption process takes place.

# decryption
This process is just the opposite of encryption
